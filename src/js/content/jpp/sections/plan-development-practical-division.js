                                Major General Martinez receives V Corps OPORD from Lieutenant General Thompson, conducting MDMP Mission Analysis (FM 5-0, Chapter 4) for 1st Infantry Division defensive economy of force mission. Corps guidance specifies: (1) Defend Warsaw northern approaches along 45km front, (2) Conduct multi-brigade defensive operations with economy of force posture, (3) Integrate with Polish 16th Mechanized Division (12,000) in combined task forces, (4) Achieve tactical objectives within 72-hour timeline. Division G-3 conducts mission analysis using METT-TC framework: Mission - defend key terrain and disrupt enemy advance, Enemy - reinforced motorized rifle regiment (8,000 personnel), Terrain - urban approaches with limited mobility corridors, Troops - three brigade combat teams plus coalition forces, Time - compressed 72-hour planning cycle, Civilian considerations - 2.1 million Polish civilians requiring protection. Mission analysis produces: restated mission, commander's intent, planning guidance, and initial CCIR (ADP 5-0, Chapter 3).

                                Major General Martinez issues commander's intent: "1st Infantry Division will conduct economy of force defensive operations to defeat enemy penetration attempts in Warsaw northern approaches, protect Polish civilian population, and maintain coalition unity. We will maximize terrain advantages while preserving combat power for future operations." Division develops three COAs: COA 1 - Forward defense with brigades in sector, COA 2 - Defense in depth with mobile reserves, COA 3 - Delay with prepared positions. Selected COA produces Division OPORD with five paragraphs: (1) Situation, (2) Mission, (3) Execution with brigade task organization, (4) Sustainment, (5) Command and Signal. Brigade missions: 1st ABCT - Northern sector (urban defense), 2nd ABCT - Central sector (key terrain defense), 1st SBCT - Southern sector (mobile defense), Division Artillery - General support fires, CAB - Close combat attack. OPORD includes tactical synchronization matrix, decision support template, and execution timeline (FM 5-0, Chapter 4).

Compressed LSCO battle rhythm: Daily DPG synchronization (0600-0630), Brigade coordination calls (0700, 1300, 1900), Adjacent unit coordination with 1st Cavalry Division (left) and 1st Armored Division (right) every 6 hours. Critical decision points at 24, 48, and 72-hour marks for plan refinement and execution authorization. Planning products include: Division OPORD, Brigade mission analysis packets, tactical synchronization matrix, and decision support template distributed through Mission Command Information Systems (MCIS). Liaison officers with Polish 16th Mechanized Division and adjacent U.S. divisions ensure boundary coordination and mutual support (FM 6-0, Chapter 2).

                                Division develops tactical synchronization matrix integrating all warfighting functions (FM 3-90, Chapter 4): PHASE I (H-6 to H-Hour) - Initial defensive positioning with brigades occupying battle positions along 45km front. 1st ABCT establishes urban defense positions, 2nd ABCT occupies key terrain, 1st SBCT establishes mobile defense positions. PHASE II (H-Hour to H+12) - Conduct defensive operations to defeat initial enemy assault with coordinated fires and maneuver. PHASE III (H+12 to H+24) - Execute counterattack operations using division reserve to defeat enemy penetration. PHASE IV (H+24 to H+48) - Transition to pursuit or consolidation based on enemy actions. Synchronization matrix includes: timeline, decisive points, brigade tasks, fires coordination, intelligence collection, sustainment activities, and decision points. Matrix coordinates with Polish 16th Mechanized Division and adjacent U.S. divisions for boundary management and mutual support. Decision Support Template identifies named areas of interest (NAI), target areas of interest (TAI), and decision points for commander approval.

                                1st Infantry Division establishes comprehensive performance assessment framework measuring tactical effectiveness across all brigades: Daily tactical assessments track brigade progress, enemy capabilities, friendly readiness, and resource consumption within each brigade sector. Weekly tactical assessments evaluate brigade performance, coalition integration, logistics sustainment, and intelligence effectiveness. Monthly operational assessments analyze division progress, V Corps guidance implementation, adversary adaptation, and coalition cohesion. Assessment metrics include: mission accomplishment rates, casualty ratios, equipment readiness levels, logistics consumption rates, intelligence collection effectiveness, and coalition coordination success. Assessment results inform adaptive planning, resource allocation, and tactical decision-making at brigade and battalion levels. Lessons learned program captures best practices and tactical innovations for dissemination to V Corps headquarters and adjacent divisions. Urban warfare lessons learned focus on building clearing techniques, civilian protection measures, and infrastructure preservation methods.

                            1st Infantry Division successfully integrates MDMP with JPP Step 7 outputs, translating V Corps OPORD into brigade-level execution across three brigades (1st ABCT, 2nd ABCT, 1st SBCT) covering 45km front with 16,500 U.S. personnel in defensive economy of force mission. Comprehensive planning integrates Polish 16th Mechanized Division (12,000 personnel), adjacent unit coordination, tactical synchronization matrix, and compressed LSCO timelines. Division OPORD and supporting products ensure synchronized operations and unity of effort across all subordinate brigades in Warsaw northern approaches (FM 5-0, Chapter 4).
