JP 5-0 establishes that Regiment COA comparison must systematically evaluate operational alternatives using weighted criteria that reflect Regiment operational requirements, squadron integration, multi-domain coordination, and coalition support within the Division commander's operational framework and intent.</p>

Operational risk encompasses squadron coordination, force protection, and mission failure with specific attention to Regiment command and control vulnerabilities, operational tempo sustainability, and multi-domain integration challenges. Logistical risk includes sustainment, transportation, and supply chain vulnerabilities with emphasis on Regiment supply line security, maintenance capability, and operational endurance. Coalition risk addresses allied Regiment integration, burden sharing, and interoperability challenges including command relationship complexity, resource sharing agreements, and operational coordination difficulties. Information risk covers Regiment communications, cyber vulnerabilities, and intelligence security with focus on operational security, information operations threats, and cyber domain protection.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;"><strong style="color: #fca5a5;">Regiment Risk Assessment Methodology:</strong> Comprehensive identification of Regiment operational risks across all domains and squadron operations with High (>70%), Medium (30-70%), Low (<30%) probability classifications for Regiment operations. Impact analysis includes Critical (mission failure), Significant (major degradation), Moderate (limited impact), or Minor (negligible effect) impact on Regiment operational objectives with combined probability and impact assessment for Regiment risk prioritization. The methodology incorporates operational environment analysis, threat assessment, capability evaluation, and vulnerability identification to provide comprehensive risk characterization for each COA within the Regiment operational context and Division operational framework.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;"><strong style="color: #fca5a5;">Regiment Risk Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Each identified Regiment operational risk requires specific mitigation strategies aligned with CJCSM 3105.01 risk management principles. Accept strategies acknowledge risks that fall within Regiment risk tolerance levels and Division operational guidance. Avoid strategies eliminate risk exposure through operational design changes or alternative approaches. Control strategies reduce risk probability or impact through operational measures, redundancy, or protective actions. Transfer strategies shift risk responsibility to other organizations, coalition partners, or higher headquarters while maintaining Regiment operational effectiveness and mission accomplishment capability.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0;"><strong style="color: #67e8f9;">Resource Comparison Methodology:</strong> Each COA must be evaluated for total Regiment operational resource requirements, resource sustainability over multiple planning horizons, coalition resource contributions, operational opportunity costs, and resource allocation efficiency to support Regiment operational decision-making with comprehensive resource analysis within Division operational framework. Resource optimization modeling examines alternative resource allocation strategies and operational effectiveness trade-offs. Resource sensitivity analysis identifies critical resource factors that significantly affect Regiment operational capability. Resource scenario analysis evaluates Regiment resource requirements under different operational conditions and threat environments. Resource integration analysis ensures Regiment resource planning aligns with Division resource allocation and operational priorities.</p>
