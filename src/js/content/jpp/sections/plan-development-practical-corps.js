                                Lieutenant General Thompson receives First Army OPORD from General Richardson, conducting corps operational planning (FM 3-92, Chapter 3) for V Corps central sector operations. Army guidance specifies: (1) Defend Central Poland along 180km front, (2) Conduct multi-division defensive operations with deep operations, (3) Integrate with Polish II Corps (28,000) and German 10th Panzer Division (12,000) in combined operations, (4) Achieve operational objectives within 96-hour timeline. Corps planning integrates close operations (division sectors), deep operations (corps assets beyond division boundaries), and rear operations (sustainment and protection). Mission analysis using operational factors: Mission - defend key terrain and defeat enemy penetration through operational depth, Enemy - combined arms army (35,000 personnel), Terrain - mixed urban/rural with Vistula River obstacle, Troops - three divisions plus coalition forces, Time - compressed 96-hour planning cycle, Civilian considerations - 8 million Polish civilians requiring protection. Corps develops operational approach integrating deep fires, intelligence operations, and division coordination (FM 3-92, Chapter 3).

                                Lieutenant General Thompson issues comprehensive commander's intent following FM 3-92 corps operations doctrine: "V Corps will conduct decisive multi-division defensive operations to defeat adversary penetration attempts, protect Polish population centers, and maintain coalition unity in central sector. We will demonstrate American resolve while minimizing civilian casualties and infrastructure damage." Planning priorities integrate close, deep, and rear operations (FM 3-92, Chapter 3): (1) 1st Infantry Division - Northern subsector (Warsaw approaches), (2) 3rd Infantry Division - Central subsector (Lodz-Wroclaw axis), (3) 1st Armored Division - Southern subsector (Wroclaw approaches), (4) 2nd ABCT - Corps reserve (Poznan area). Each division receives specific mission, boundaries, priorities of fire, and coordination requirements. Corps planning follows FM 5-0 procedures with compressed LSCO timeline: 96-hour MDMP cycle, 48-hour execution preparation.

                                V Corps develops comprehensive scheme of maneuver for multi-division defensive operations: PHASE I - Initial defensive positioning with divisions occupying prepared battle positions along key terrain features. 1st Infantry Division establishes defense in depth along Warsaw-Lodz corridor, 1st Cavalry Division conducts mobile defense in central plains, 1st Armored Division establishes strongpoint defense along southern approaches. PHASE II - Conduct spoiling attacks and counter-reconnaissance operations to disrupt adversary advance and force deployment. PHASE III - Execute decisive counterattack operations using corps reserve and division reserves to defeat adversary penetration attempts. PHASE IV - Transition to pursuit operations to exploit adversary withdrawal and restore territorial integrity. Each phase includes specific objectives, timelines, decision points, and success criteria for all subordinate divisions.

Division artillery provides direct support fires within division sectors using M109A7 Paladin self-propelled howitzers and M777 towed howitzers. Air support coordination includes close air support, battlefield air interdiction, and strategic attack missions coordinated through Corps Air Support Operations Center (ASOC). Electronic warfare assets conduct signals intelligence collection and electronic attack missions. Cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA) cell coordinates with higher headquarters for offensive cyber operations. Target acquisition assets include counter-battery radars, unmanned aircraft systems, and ground surveillance radars. Fire support coordination measures ensure deconfliction and synchronized effects across all warfighting functions.

                                V Corps establishes comprehensive performance assessment framework measuring operational effectiveness across all divisions: Daily operational assessments track tactical progress, enemy capabilities, friendly readiness, and resource consumption within each division sector. Weekly operational assessments evaluate division performance, coalition integration, logistics sustainment, and intelligence effectiveness. Monthly strategic assessments analyze corps progress, Army guidance implementation, adversary adaptation, and coalition cohesion. Assessment metrics include: mission accomplishment rates, casualty ratios, equipment readiness levels, logistics consumption rates, intelligence collection effectiveness, and coalition coordination success. Assessment results inform adaptive planning, resource allocation, and tactical decision-making at division and brigade levels. Lessons learned program captures best practices and tactical innovations for dissemination to Army headquarters and adjacent corps.
