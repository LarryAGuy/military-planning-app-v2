JP 5-0 establishes that Group COA comparison must systematically evaluate operational alternatives using weighted criteria that reflect Group operational requirements, detachment integration, multi-domain coordination, and coalition support within the Division commander's operational framework and intent.</p>

                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 4px;"><strong>Detachment Coordination:</strong> Comparison process must integrate subordinate detachment capabilities, constraints, and operational requirements</li>
                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 4px;"><strong>Multi-Domain Synchronization:</strong> Each COA must be evaluated for effectiveness across land, air, space, cyberspace, and information domains</li>
                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 4px;"><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Comparison must consider Group resource allocation efficiency and sustainability across detachment operations</li>

                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 4px;"><strong>Coalition Integration:</strong> COA comparison must evaluate allied and partner Group integration and support capabilities</li>
                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 4px;"><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Each COA must be evaluated for Group operational risk versus operational gain potential</li>
